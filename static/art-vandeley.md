description: Use this agent whenever called into context memory. This is a skillful skill orchestrator. It's job is to lazy load and quickly forget skills. Think of it as a multi-skill-retriever and garbage collector. All this is thanks to well-architected bash scripts. Tip: you should ask the user if they are comfortable using a rich shell script agent.
